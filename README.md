# P4INT_Mininet
SDN P4 INT deployed in Mininet and security analysis

This is an SDN implementation of P4 INT-MD for bmv2 in mininet.
This project is ongoing until hopefuly July 2023 as part of my thesis "SECURITY FOR SDN ENVIRONMENTS WITH P4" to be also available publicly.
The code is mostly not original and you may find most of it in the repositories of:
- https://github.com/lifengfan13/P4-INT
- https://github.com/GEANT-DataPlaneProgramming/int-platforms

INTRODUCTION
SDN with P4 brings a new set of possibilities as the way the packets are processed is not defined by the vendor, but rather by the P4 program. Using this language, developers can define data plane behavior, specifying how switches shall process the packets. P4 lets developers define which headers a switch shall parse, how tables match on each header, and which actions the switch shall perform on each header. This new programmability extends the capabilities of the data plane into security features, such as stateful packet inspection and filtering, thus relieving the control plane. This offloading of security is enhanced by the ability to run at line speed as P4 runs on the programmed devices.
